# Samklang

Will be alive. And it will aim to be a collaboration tool for non-profit
organizations like wind bands. More to come later, and maybe it will mature for
something suitable for companies as well.

But there is nothing to see yet.

# Contribute

Please contribute if you have the slightest interest in this project.
Javascript hacking is most needed now. Later, we will need translations and
testers.

We are a tiny company that will make this as a free (as in open source)
platform for everybody to run and use. We develop this tool for free, and _may_
generate some income (for us or for you) on hosting or configuration.
